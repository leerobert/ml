## Why Neurons

A typical cortical neuron consists of a cell body, an axon hillock where it can send messages to other neurons, and a dendritic tree where it can receive messages from other neurons.
This inspires the neural network structure of containing interlinked neurons that pass messages between each other. Synapses are the the small gaps that split two connected neurons 
and allow for the interchange of activity through the release of neurotransmitters. Synapses constantly mutate to either strengthen or weaken
the bond between the two neurons. This adaption of the synapses is the primary driver of "learning" in a neural network. 


## Idealized Neuron

Let's imagine the simplest neuron to probe the neuronal activity. 

### Linear Neuron


## Threshold Neuron


### Sigmoid Neuron


## Types of Machine Learning

Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement
